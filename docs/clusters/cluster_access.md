# Access to NJIT Clusters
The following instructions are provided to access NJIT HPC clusters from a local computer.

## Getting a Login
Faculty can obtain a login to NJIT's HPC by sending an email to [hpc@njit.edu](mailto:hpc@njit.edu). Students can obtain a login either by taking a class that uses one of the systems or by asking their faculty adviser to [contact](mailto:hpc@njit.edu) on their behalf. Your login and password are the same as for any NJIT AFS system.

## Access to Clusters
Make sure the user is connected to `NJITsecure` if the user is on campus. If working off campus, NJIT VPN is required. Please find the details [here](https://ist.njit.edu/vpn).
Here we will provide instructions for connecting to NJIT HPC on Mac/Linux and Windows OS.

!!! Update

    In the recent update (Sep 10th 2024) Cisco two-factor authentication (TFA) is deployed, similar to what is already deployed on NJIT websites and VPN. 

=== "Mac/Linux"

    Open terminal from <kbd>Launchpad</kbd> and select <kbd>terminal</kbd>.
    Type the following in the terminal by substituting `wulver` or `lochness` for `HPC_HOST` and `ucid` with your NJIT UCID.
    ```
      localhost> ssh -X -Y ucid@HPC_HOST.njit.edu  
    ```
    
    Users will be prompted for your password. Enter your NJIT UCID password. Users can omit the `-X -Y` if you are not using a graphic interface. Once the password is provided, User will authenticate via Cisco two-factor authentication (TFA)
    
    ```
    (guest@wulver.njit.edu) Duo two-factor login for guest

    Enter a passcode or select one of the following options:

    1. Duo Push to XXX-XXX-2332
    2. Phone call to XXX-XXX-2332

## Transfer the Data from the Local Machine to Clusters or vice versa

=== "Mac/Linux"

    Users need to use the command in the terminal to transfer in and out the data 

    ### `rsync`:
    * Transfer the data from local machine to HPC cluster
    ```
    rsync -avzP /path/to/local/machine ucid@wulver.njit.edu:/path/to/destination
    ```
    
    * To transfer the data from HPC cluster to local machine use
    ```
    rsync -avzP ucid@wulver.njit.edu:/path/to/source /path/to/local/machine
    ```
    ### `scp`:
    * Copy files from remote machine to local machine
    ```
    scp [option] [ucid@wulver.njit.edu:path/to/source/file] [target/path]
    ```

    * Copy files from local machine to remote machine
    ```
    scp [option] [path/to/source/file] [ucid@wulver.njit.edu:target/path] 
    ```

    * Example of scp:
    ```
    scp -r example ucid@wulver.njit.edu:/home/dir 
    ```
    Copy the “example” folder recursively to `/home/dir`


=== "Windows"

    User needs to select the `follow terminal folder` of the left pane of the MobaXterm terminal.
